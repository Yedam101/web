<h1>AlphaGo</h1>

<b>AlphaGo</b> is a computer program that plays the board game Go.
It was developed by <u>DeepMind Technologies a subsidiary of Google (now Alphabet Inc.).</u>
<p> Subsequent versions of AlphaGo became increasingly powerful, including a version that competed under the name Master.
  After retiring from competitive play, AlphaGo Master was succeeded by an even more powerful version known as AlphaGo Zero, which was completely self-taught without learning from human games. AlphaGo Zero was then generalized into a program known as AlphaZero, which played additional games, including chess and shogi. AlphaZero has in turn been succeeded by a program known as MuZero which learns without being taught the rules.</p>
